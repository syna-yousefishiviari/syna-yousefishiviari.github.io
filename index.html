								<p>During my internship at Qualcomm, I had the enriching experience of contributing to the Software Verification team. I played a vital role in developing Nuvia's inaugural PC chip and the next-generation Snapdragon SoC for mobile and automotive applications. My responsibilities included creating Python scripts for parsing Lauterbach TRACE32 register dumps, developing a variety of manual and automated test cases across functional, setup, and performance domains, and collaborating with the DevOps team for CI/CD pipeline integration on GitLab. Utilizing the Parasoft Unit Testing Framework, I also crafted a Proof of Concept for the Power and Limits team’s firmware. My work on the inaugural Nuvia chip, a highlight of my internship, allowed me to contribute to a groundbreaking project, where I ensured the highest standards of quality and performance were met, leaving me with invaluable skills and experiences in the field of software engineering.

My responsibilities also extended to weekly strategic meetings with managers and executives, where I presented well-received business solutions and advertising plans, many of which were subsequently implemented. Collaborating closely with the marketing and design teams, we successfully created a visually appealing website, contributing significantly to an improved customer experience and ultimately, boosting sales. My role involved not just front-end development, but also troubleshooting, optimizing code, and designing and presenting technical solutions to clients through meetings and live demonstrations, showcasing my versatile skill set and the ability to contribute to various facets of the business.
